This project was done during one of our "Project Weeks" during my time at <a href="http://www.pixlvisn.com" target="_blank">pixlvisn</a>. During project weeks, we receive the topic on Monday and have to be done by Sunday 12AM.

This was our second end-term project week, meaning I was in school for 6 months at the time I worked on this project.

Even though we did not learn Substance Designer or Painter, I stumbled across Allegorithmic's programs and decided to learn them about 1 week before project week and then proceeded to use both Substance Painter and Designer for this assignment.
