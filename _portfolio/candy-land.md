This project was done during one of our "Project Weeks" during my time at <a href="http://www.pixlvisn.com" target="_blank">pixlvisn</a>. During project weeks, we receive the topic on Monday and have to be done by Sunday 12AM.

This was our fourth end-term project week, meaning I was in school for one year at the time I worked on this project.

For this project we had to create 15 assets, build a scene out of them, and then light and render it.

I decided to use VRay instead of Mental Ray for this project because our school recently acquired a lot of licences for VRay. Since I read and watched a lot of things on VRay already, I didn't have a problem with using another renderer than the one we learned at school (Mental Ray).
