Well, I know this is very disappointing, but I just created my website and most of my tools still need a fancy UI for me to publish them and not feel bad about it.

I'm currently working on a Python script that runs through an Excel sheet and a folder full of PDFs to then calculate where each PDF should go in an InDesign file. (And also places it there afterwards)

When I'm finished with that I'll be able to go back to my older scripts for Maya and make them fancy.

See ya soon!
